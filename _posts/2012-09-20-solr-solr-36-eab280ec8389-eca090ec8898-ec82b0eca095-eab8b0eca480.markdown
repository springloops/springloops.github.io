## How are documents scored

Basic scoring factors:

  * tf stands for term frequency - the more times a search term appears in a document, the higher the score
  * idf stands for inverse document frequency - matches on rarer terms count more than matches on common terms
  * coord is the coordination factor - if there are multiple terms in a query, the more terms that match, the higher the score
  * lengthNorm - matches on a smaller field score higher than matches on a larger field
  * index-time boost - if a boost was specified for a document at index time, scores for searches that match that document will be boosted.
  * query clause boost - a user may explicitly boost the contribution of one part of a query over another.
